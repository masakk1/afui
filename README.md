# afui
This is a community maintained UI component library for Fusion.
It might not have everything, but it *wil* have some components to use alongside Fusion.

I'm pretty sure you can use this with Roact or any other ui library, since it just asks for some settings and returns an instance. But it will require Fusion as a dependency.

# Installing
